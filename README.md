# Project Title

खँग्वःसफू literally translates as dictionary in Nepal Bhasa.

A passion project aimed at connecting German, English, and Nepali speakers through simple and accessible translations. Please note that this dictionary is a hobbyist endeavor and may not cover every nuance of the languages. It's my way of sharing the beauty of Nepal Bhasa with the world, and I hope it helps you explore the language and its cultural richness.

<b>Category</b>: English, German and Nepal Bhasa dictionary.
